# PG Discrod Bot

### Why did I do it?
When going to college I created a messenger group for all my friends that also got into the same college. It grew so quickly, that I decided to create discord server and write small bot for that purpose. A friend of mine decided to post the invite link to that server on official Facebook group made by Students Faculty Council. After a few days members count exceeded 1k. 

### What now?
Sadly discontinued due to lack of time and costs related to hosting.

### Technologies 
I wrote it with C# and DSharpPlus API library for discord.
