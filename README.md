### Why did I create it?
When I started college, I created a Messenger group for my friends who also got in. It grew so quickly that I decided to set up a Discord server and develop a small bot to manage it. A friend of mine then shared the invite link in the official Facebook group run by the Student Faculty Council. Within a few days, the serverâ€™s member count exceeded 1,000.

The bot provided several useful functionalities, including:

- Keeping an up-to-date server statistics page
- Reaction roles for faculty and recreational channels
- Automated category creation with templated channels
- A few eastereggs
- And a couple more

### Current status
Unfortunately, the project has been discontinued due to time constraints and hosting costs.

### Technologies 
The bot was built using C# and the DSharpPlus API for Discord integration.
